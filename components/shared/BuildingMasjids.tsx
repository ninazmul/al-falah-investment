          Masjids are the heart of the Muslim community, and they serve as more
          than just places of worship. They are centres for learning, social
          interaction, and spiritual growth. As part of our mission, we aim to
          build and expand masjids that function as vibrant community hubs,
          providing educational programs for all ages, from young children to
          adults.
