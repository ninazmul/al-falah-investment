          Establishing primary and secondary schools that integrate both secular
          and Islamic education is at the core of our mission. These schools
          will provide students with an academically rigorous curriculum while
          embedding Islamic teachings in every aspect of learning. The goal is
          to nurture well-rounded individuals who are not only knowledgeable in
          mathematics, science, and humanities but also equipped with a strong
          moral compass rooted in Islamic principles.
